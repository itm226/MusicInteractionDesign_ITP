Oblique Strategy: "Only a part, not the whole"

This is an instrument that lives on a table and can be played by anyone. Specifically, the instrument is a piece of paper, which, when crinkled, ruined, or destroyed, alters parts/parameters of the piece represented by the paper.  For instance, when untouched, the original sample/song plays as originally intended. However, when the paper is ripped in half, half of the information of the sample is lost: the sample rate may be halved, or the bit depth halved, or the tempo is cut in half, or half the file is deleted. Of course, when the paper is ripped in half, you don't have one broken controller, controlling one sound process, but maybe two...or three...or four! The system is kind of like a mutant star fish in this way. When crinkled into a ball, the sound of its associated process is filtered and the note events are clustered in time. Similarly, if the paper is rolled up into a shape like a tube, the frequency range of the music will expand: if the first the original piece lived between 200--1200Hz, the modified sound might range between 80--12000Hz, while its novel events are expanded in time. The size of the instrument is will be determined by the size of the paper used and also the size of the hardware used to measure the paper, monitoring it for meaningful change.
